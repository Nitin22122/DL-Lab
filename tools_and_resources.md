Google Colab, Cloning GitHub repository, Upload Data, Importing Kaggle's dataset.


Google Colab : 
Google Colab is a cloud-based notebook environment that lets you write and run Python code in your browser. It does not need any local setup and provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which is useful for data science and machine learning tasks. You can easily upload files, connect Google Drive, and share notebooks.


Cloning a GitHub Repository : 
Cloning a GitHub repository means copying an existing project from GitHub to your local system or Colab environment. This helps you reuse code, study existing implementations, or continue development. In Colab, repositories are usually cloned using Git commands.


Uploading Data :
 Uploading data refers to adding datasets (CSV, Excel, images, etc.) into the working environment. In Google Colab, data can be uploaded directly from your system or accessed through Google Drive. This data is then used for analysis, training models, or visualization.


Importing Kaggle Dataset :
 Kaggle provides large, real-world datasets for practice and research. Importing a Kaggle dataset means downloading it into your project environment using the Kaggle API. This allows you to work with structured, high-quality datasets commonly used in machine learning and data analysis experiments.
